## Security Architecture

Solo-Code CLI is a zero-dependency harness (Python stdlib only, Node.js plugins only).
Key security boundaries:

| Boundary | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Destructive command prevention | Guard plugin v2.5 — 33 destructive patterns blocked |
| Secret detection | Pre-commit hooks + `security_scan.py` — 11 secret patterns |
| Git safety | No force-push to main, commit message scanning |
| Config protection | 19 protected config files (ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, etc.) |
| Input validation | All user input treated as untrusted |

For architecture details, see `.kilohack/instruction/security-patterns.md` and
`AGENTS.md` Security Rules section.
