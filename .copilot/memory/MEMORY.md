# Memory Index

High-signal context loaded at session start. Detailed history belongs in
`decisions-archive.md`; keep this file below the 8,000-character gate.

## Project
- [project] Branches: `feature/[task-slug]` or `fix/[bug-slug]`.
- [project] `AGENTS.md` is the root rulebook; `.harness.lock` defines boundaries.
- [project] `.kilo/` is source of truth. Claude and OpenCode are generated from
  it; Copilot/Gemini are parity-checked.

## Rules
- [rules] Read before editing; make surgical changes; verify syntax and tests.
- [rules] User input is untrusted. Parameterize SQL; keep credentials in env vars.
- [rules] Ask before destructive actions, dependency installs, CI changes, or
  deletion.
- [rules] Use `permission-guard`; executor mode is ON by default. Run the
  security scan before committing.

## Tech Stack
- [tech] Python 3.10+ stdlib runtime for `tools/` and `.github/scripts/`;
  pytest/ruff are dev tools. Kilo hooks use Node.js 18+.
- [tech] Ruff config: `.ruff.toml`; secrets: `.gitleaks.toml`.
- [tech] Codex CLI 0.154.0 (npm global) is a harness consumer: it reads
  `AGENTS.md` natively, so no `.codex/` engine mirror is generated. Launcher
  `codex-env.ps1`, metering `tools/codex_usage.py`.
- [tech] SQLite shared state: `.solocode/shared-state.db`. Only `session_log`
  actually has rows; `features` and `shared_memory_*` exist but are unused —
  git log plus this file cover task tracking and conventions. `codex` is a
  valid engine name in `tools/shared_state.py`.

## Verification
- [verify] Full Codex gate: `python tools/codex_verify.py`.
- [verify] Individual gates: security scan, schema validation, garden,
  no-skips, pytest.
- [verify] Codex has no repository hook API, so use `tools/codex_guard.py` for
  destructive-command, secret, and file-lock preflight checks.

## Gotchas
- [gotcha] Bare Codex does not load `.env`; always run via the launcher.
- [gotcha] Codex gateway needs `code_mode.enabled = false`,
  `unified_exec = false`, `wire_api = "responses"`, and a full-access sandbox.
- [gotcha] Codex base URLs do not interpolate `${VAR}`; the launcher passes a
  `-c model_providers.<id>.base_url=...` override instead.
- [gotcha] TOML bare keys must precede the first table header.
- [gotcha] Keep loaded memory under 8,000 chars. MOVE pruned material into
  `decisions-archive.md` verbatim — never silently delete it.
- [gotcha] `.pytest_temp` cleanup can race on Windows; rerun pytest if needed.

## Decisions
- [decision] Claude launchers default to full mode; `--bare` is explicit
  degraded mode.
- [decision] OpenCode avoids duplicate skill mirrors and uses Claude-compatible
  skills.
- [decision] Codex lifecycle and guard behavior is launcher-based, because Codex
  has no project hooks. Of the gateway's aliases only `gpt-5.6-terra` routes
  reproducibly; the rest are unstable or dead — measurements and traps are in
  `decisions-archive.md` (2026-09-14).
