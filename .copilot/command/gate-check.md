Run all verification gates in order. Stop at the first failure.

## Context

- Current branch: execute `git branch --show-current` to display
- Last commit: execute `git log --oneline -1` to display
- Changed files: execute `git diff --stat HEAD` to display

## Gates

### Gate 1: Security Scan
```bash
python .github/scripts/security_scan.py . --strict
```
Expected: exit 0, "No issues found."

### Gate 2: Lint
```bash
ruff check .
```
Expected: exit 0, no errors.

### Gate 3: Garden (Drift Detection)
```bash
python tools/garden.py
```
Expected: "0 errors, 0 warnings"

### Gate 4: Integration Tests
```bash
python tools/test_integration.py
```
Expected: all gates green.

### Gate 5: Harness Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tools/ -q
```
Expected: all tests pass.

### Gate 6: Eval Score
```bash
python tools/eval_harness.py --min-score 60
```
Expected: score >= 60.

### Gate 7: Debug Artifacts
Check for leftover debug statements:
- `console.log` / `console.debug` in `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`
- `print()` with `# debug` in `.py`
- `pdb.set_trace()` or `breakpoint()` in `.py`
- `debugger` statement in any file
- Exclude `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `.git/`, `__pycache__/`
